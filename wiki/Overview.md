The intent of this note is to propose a plan on how we (MK Test Systems) can improve the internal training of key domain knowledge required for electronics engineers to carry out technical design tasks. The initial focus of this program will be on electronics for practical circuit design. However, it is hoped that the the scope can be increased to include technical skills such as Python, Git, etc. 

## Electronics for Practical Circuit Design
The primary focus of this training is to build up the knowledge, experience and confidence to allow the engaged participant to be able to complete circuit design tasks independently. 
**Note**: I say independently but having design conversations and collaboration with other engineers is always encouraged no matter the competency level. 

**The training should result in the following outcomes:**
- Effective component selection for a given application
    - Able to highlight the component parameters that matter in a given application
    - Efficient reading of component datasheets
    - An understanding of the problems of 'real' components
- Building a toolbox of commonly used circuits
- How to approach a circuit design task from a set of requirements to a characterised circuit
- How to apply protection circuitry to handle real world application
- How circuit design affects design for manufacture and test
- Using simulation and validation effectively
    - Able to set up and run SPICE simulations
    - Understand the limitations of simulations compared to real-world measurements
- Applying PCB design considerations
    - Awareness of how layout affects circuit behaviour (parasitics, grounding, EMI, noise)
    - Translating a schematic into a PCB layout with good design practice
- Developing measurement and debugging skills
    - Confident use of oscilloscopes, multimeters, and other lab tools
    - Systematic troubleshooting methods for non-functioning circuits
- Designing stable and reliable power supplies
    - Selecting and applying regulators, filters, and decoupling capacitors
    - Managing power distribution, sequencing, and multiple rails
- Ensuring reliability and robustness
    - Applying component derating for longevity
    - Considering environmental factors (temperature, vibration, humidity, etc.)
- Documenting and communicating circuit designs
    - Recording design decisions and test results in a clear, structured way
    - Preparing design documentation for manufacturing or handover
